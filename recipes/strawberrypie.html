        <h2>Description </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Simple strawberry pie</strong> with fresh strawberries coated in a light strawberry
             glaze, and then topped with whipped cream.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chilled pie dough for one 9-inch pie</li>
            <li>5 cups (24 ounces or 680 grams) quartered and hulled strawberries</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (30 grams) cornstarch</li>
            <li>2/3 to 3/4 cup (134 to 150 grams) sugar, adjusted according to the sweetness 
                of strawberries</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cream</li>
            <li>Whipped cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
        <h3>PREPARE CRUST</h3>
            <li>Roll out pie dough to fit pie dish. Gently press dough down into 
                dish so that it lines the bottom and sides of the dish. 
                (Be careful not to pull or stretch the dough). Then, use a knife 
                or pair of kitchen scissors to trim dough to within 1/2-inch of 
                the edge of the dish.</li>
            <li>Fold edges of dough underneath itself, creating a thicker, 1/4-inch
                 border that rests on the lip of the dish. Then, crimp edges.</li></ol>
            <h3>BAKE CRUST</h3> <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 425 degrees F (220 C). Place a baking sheet on a middle
                 oven rack.</li> 
            <li>Pierce bottom of the crust with a fork (this prevent air pockets or
                 bubbles from forming while baking). Line the crust with two sheets
                  of aluminum foil. (Be sure to push foil against the edges of the 
                  crust). Then, fill foil with dried rice, dried beans or pie 
                  weights. Refrigerate 30 minutes or freeze for 10 minutes, or until
                   firm to the touch.</li> 
            <li>Place pie crust onto preheated baking sheet and reduce oven temperature
                 to 400 degrees F (200 C). Bake 20 to 30 minutes or until the crust is 
                 golden.</li> 
            <li>Make egg wash by whisking egg yolk and cream in a small bowl. Then, 
                remove rice, beans or pie weights and foil from pie crust. Brush bottom 
                and sides of crust with egg wash. Bake until egg wash is dry and shiny,
                 3 to 5 minutes. Cool crust completely before filling.</li> </ol>
            <h3>MAKE FILLING</h3><ol>
            <li>Add 2 cups of strawberries to a small saucepan. Mash strawberries until
                 chunky. Add sugar, corn starch, vanilla extract, almond extract, lemon 
                 juice and salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring
                 occasionally, until sugar dissolves and glaze has thickened; 3 to 5 
                 minutes. Cool completely.</li></ol>
            <h3>TO FINISH</h3> <ol>
            <li>Combine remaining 3 cups of strawberries with cooled strawberry glaze. 
                Stir until strawberries are well coated. Spoon strawberry filling into
                 cooled pie crust.</li> 
            <li>Refrigerate pie at least 2 hours before cutting to allow filling to set.
                Top with whipped cream.</li> 
        </ol>
